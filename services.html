            <p class="service-description">Initially joining Salt Esports as a Graphic Designer, I worked my way to now being a co-owner in the team. 
                Salt Esports boasts a major lineup of different gaming athletes across the country, since 2020, Salt Esports reached the pinnacle of Pakistani FPS Esports
            by becoming winners of VCC'21.
            <br/> My role in the team comes to managing Operations, where I look after the Content Team, The recruitment team, as well as the Marketing Team.
            <br/> Salt Esports was also invited by PITB as a prospective start-up and is currently working with brands like Nayza, as well as previously having worked
            with Redbull, Coca-Cola etc  </p>

            <div class="service-title">GRAPHIC DESIGN.</div>
            <p class="service-description">What started as the need of a channel art for my "Youtube Channel" turned into the pursuit of doing freelance gigs which in turn
                became a side-hustle. My passion for Graphic Design led me to working with clients across the world through the means of Fiverr, Twitter, and more.
                <br/>Through Graphic Design, I was able to master the skill of Photoshop as well as learnt how to use Adobe Illustrator, Cinema 4D, Blender, and more.  
                <br/>This in turn helped me later in my life to pursue Entrepreneurship, as my Graphic Design skills translated to launching my own clothing start-up, DiffusePK.</p>

            <div class="service-title">PROGRAMMING.</div>
            <p class="service-description">As someone who has been exposed wholely to the Internet, my introduction to programming came at a very early age. However, due to me
                pursuing Graphic Design, I did not focus on learning programming.
                <br/> My big break however came when I enrolled into GIK for a Bachelors in Computer Science, this enabled me to learn various different thing related to 
                programming. From learning Artificial Neural Networks to create a game of Tic-Tac-Toe, to combating clustering. Personally, my passion lies towards Game Development
                which is why I am currently learning Unreal Engine 5.
